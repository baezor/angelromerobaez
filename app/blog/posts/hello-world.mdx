## Hi, again.

I have decided to start writing again, but I'm taking it seriously now.

Self-reflection, critical thinking, and sustaining focus for more extended sessions are the most important skills someone can have, and writing is a great way to improve them, if not the best.

Iâ€™ll write about:

- Something that someone else can find helpful in the future
- How to solve specific technical problems
- My journey to weight loss
- Daily thoughts
- Books, news, and other things that I find interesting
- Habits and strategies I am implementing to improve my ability to concentrate.

I hope you find something useful.

Have a great day!
